# Changelog

All notable changes to `anousss007/vigilance` are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Driver-agnostic capture of queue jobs (full `queued → running → done/failed`
  lifecycle), artisan commands, and scheduled tasks.
- Standalone Livewire dashboard: overview, runs, run detail, failures,
  dispatcher, command runner, schedule and workload pages.
- Manual control: dispatch allowlisted jobs (typed form reflected from the
  constructor) and run allowlisted artisan commands, with an audit log.
- Failure grouping with Sentry-style fingerprints and a `FailureRecorded` event
  for alerting.
- Metrics snapshots (throughput / runtime / wait-time) and per-driver queue
  depth.
- Production safety: dispatch-time sampling (sampled-out successes cost zero
  writes; failures always captured), size caps, secret redaction, a dedicated
  storage connection, and an anti-crash capture guard.
- Console: `vigilance:install`, `vigilance:doctor`, `vigilance:prune`,
  `vigilance:snapshot`, `vigilance:schedule-sync`.
- `php artisan about` integration and Octane state-reset hooks.
